🩺 Liver Cirrhosis Predictor

A machine learning-powered web app built with Flask that predicts the risk of liver cirrhosis based on patient data. This project helps healthcare providers and patients get early insights using clinical parameters.



🚀 Features

✅ Input patient details through a user-friendly web form

✅ ML-based prediction of liver cirrhosis risk

✅ Stores patient records in a local database (SQLite)

✅ Secure environment variables using .env

✅ Responsive and simple UI built with HTML + CSS

✅ Ready for deployment on Render / Heroku



🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Backend: Flask (Python)

Database: SQLite (patients.db)

Deployment: Render / Heroku


📌 Future Enhancements

🔹 Improve ML model with more medical datasets

🔹 Add authentication (Doctor/Patient login)

🔹 Deploy with HTTPS & custom domain

🔹 Build an advanced dashboard for doctors

🔹 Integration with EHR/medical records



🐞 Known Issues

Currently uses SQLite (not scalable for large data)
